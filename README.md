In [Semantic search with embeddings](https://rom1504.medium.com/semantic-search-with-embeddings-index-anything-8fb18556443c), I described how to build semantic search systems (also called neural search). These systems are being used more and more with indexing techniques improving and representation learning getting better every year with new deep learning papers. The medium post explain how to build them, and this list is meant to reference all interesting resources on the topic to allow anyone to quickly start building systems.
